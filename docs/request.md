Request
===

The request class handles the http request,
implements the interceptor pattern,
loads configured endpoints,
generates urls from url-patterns
and raises exceptions for any response status but 200.

  request.merge_params(params) # used for adding params to the request (e.g. inside an interceptor)

  request.url #<String> URL that is used for doing the request
